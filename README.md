# Seam Carving Project

## Overview

This project implements the seam carving algorithm for content-aware image resizing. Seam carving allows for the reduction of image size without scaling and distorting significant content. This technique selectively removes pixels which are less important, thereby preserving the visual appearance of important areas of the image.

## Features

- **Dynamic Image Resizing**: Adjust image sizes while preserving important content.
- **Content Awareness**: The algorithm detects areas with less importance automatically.
- **User Interface**: Simple GUI to upload images and see results instantly (if applicable).

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- PIL (Pillow)
- NumPy

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/seam-carving.git
cd seam-carving
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

To start the application, run:

```bash
python seam_carving.py
```

Replace `seam_carving.py` with the actual script name if different.

## Example Usage

Provide a brief example of how to use the project, maybe with a simple command line input and output if applicable.
